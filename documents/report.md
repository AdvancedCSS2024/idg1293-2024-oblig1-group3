Started identifying the main components in each screenshot and drew on top of the images.
Created a branch for each of the team members.
Started to set up the HTML for each webpage and trying our best to use BEM while doing it.
After having the main structure in the HTML file we started working on the common.scss.
Tried our best to use SASS and to nest as best as we could.
Used the svg and images found in finn.no, using inspect and copying the html from there.
Added our components to the demo.html and linked it to style.css.
