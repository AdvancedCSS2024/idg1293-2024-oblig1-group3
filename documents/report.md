Started the project with observing and identifying the main system of Finn's designsystem. 
Marked all the components on the screen shots.
Inspected the finn.no home page and the log in page. Inspected the html and css elements and found out how the code is nested.
Made the HTML file for the screen shot, as the task said. Found out later that the order in the asignment is wrong. That the demo.html was suposed to be written before the screenshot.html. 
Wrote the html and scss code, and made it look like finn.no while inspecting the finn.no site.
Implemented icons, links, buttons, inputs and in the demo.html file.
